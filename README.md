# Compressed-Sensing-for-ECG
The code related to the implementation of a Compressed Sensing (CS) algorithm for ECG is provided (MATLAB).
The algorithm is according to the method described in Eulalia Balestrieri, Luca De Vito, Francesco Picariello, Ioan Tudosa"A Novel Method for Compressed Sensing based Sampling of ECG Signals in Medical-IoT era".

Whatever you are planning to use the method for your research, please cite the above mentioned paper.

Setup: 
1) export the .rar contents of "mcode.rar" in the "main.m" folder
2) export the .rar contents of "database.rar" in the "main.m" folder
3) check the Internet connectivity
4) open in MATLAB the "main.m" file
5) run the "main.m" function
