# Compressed-Sensing-for-ECG
The codes related to the implementations of Compressed Sensing (CS) algorithms for ECG is provided (MATLAB).
The algorithms are according to: (i) the method described in Eulalia Balestrieri, Luca De Vito, Francesco Picariello, Ioan Tudosa "A Novel Method for Compressed Sensing based Sampling of ECG Signals in Medical-IoT era", and (ii) ohter CS methods available in literature, which consider Bernoulli or Gaussian distributed sensing matrices and dictionaries Mexican Hat, Symlet-4 and others.

Whatever you are planning to use the method for your research, please cite the paper: Eulalia Balestrieri, Luca De Vito, Francesco Picariello, Ioan Tudosa "A Novel Method for Compressed Sensing based Sampling of ECG Signals in Medical-IoT era"

Setup: 
1) export the .rar contents of "mcode.rar" in the "main_CS_power_based.m" folder
2) export the .rar contents of "cvx-w64.rar" in the "main_CS_power_based.m" folder and run "cvx_setup.m"
3) check the Internet connectivity
4) open in MATLAB the "main_CS_power_based.m" or the "main_Symlet_4.m" or the "performance_analysis_PRD_vs_CR_CS_power_based.m" or the "performance_analysis_PRD_vs_CR_CS_random.m" files
5) run the "main_CS_power_based.m" or the "main_Symlet_4.m" or the "performance_analysis_PRD_vs_CR_CS_power_based.m" or the "performance_analysis_PRD_vs_CR_CS_random.m" function
